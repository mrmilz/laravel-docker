# laravel-docker
Build this docker image, tag it, push it somewhere, then make a new laravel project in a different folder, copy over the docker-compose.yml, make a dockerfile that FROM's the image you build here and adds ENV APP_NAME myappname.

Altneratively, copy and paste all this stuff into an existing laravel project.
